# OPENCV APPLICATION EXAMPLES

This Repo contains a collection of OpenCV project codes that I implemented for research and study purpose. I am currently working on re-organizing this repo as well as adding new opencv application code every week. Most applications were written in Python, however, I am going to add C++ version for all of them very soon.
